Since the OverTheWire exersizes are hosted on linux I will be using Linux to ssh from.
I will also not be giving the answers on here but rather the steps for reteiving the flags.
Please go to the following url so we can start http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html

Using your terminal we will ssh bu using the following command:
 ssh <user>@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
You may need to use sudo in front of the command so be aware of that.


Bandit 0:
this is the first challenge of Bandit!

We are given the password for logging in which is "bandit0", do not use quotes unless specified.

so using "bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220", we get to the first login screen.

Step 1:
We want to look to see if there are any files or directories in our current directory.
We want to use the "ls" command, which is the command for listing the contents of a directory
Step 2:

Using the command "cat", we can view the contents of this file.
cat is a powerful command which can view the contents of a file, create files, concatenate files and redirect output.
Viewing the "readme" file reveals our first flag, which is the password for the next exercise

Bandit 1:
Now that we have found the first flag from bandit0 we can ssh into badit1 using it.

Step 1:
We are still going to use the "cat" command, but this time you will notice we
