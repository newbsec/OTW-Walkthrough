# OTW-Walkthrough
This is just another OverTheWire walkthrough!
I am an InfoSec enthusiast who is aspiring to be a pentester.
OverTheWire is a great place to learn the beginnings of BASH and what it can offer to anyone using Linux.
Join me as we go through the different stages at OverTheWire and look out for more repo's that have challenges from different sites!
